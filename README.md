# gup_raytracer

A raytracer built following _Ray Tracing from the Ground Up_ (2007) by Kevin Suffern.

Skeleton based on raytracer originally provided through http://www.raytracegroundup.com then ported by Sverre Kvaale 
to update speed and usability. 

The skeleton has been refactored to use Qt instead of wxWidgets. Currently the project is not delivered with the 
necessary Qt packages to build, a local install of Qt must be sourced.
